# mywebworkshop
I will be using this repository to test things out on mywebworkshop.online  <br />
Commit 1, 2(Sept 2):  <br />
  This was my first attempt to put html css and javascript together upload them through git to a website
  I tried out couple of ways to apply parallax effect: event.clientX to track mouse location and window.scrollY to track scroll location
  Next goal: more pages and links, how to make better view on phone/smaller screen, other interesting effect like parallax
  Further goal: log-in and leaving comments; probably require some knowledge on back-end which I haven't study so far
